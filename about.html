              Kosovo was an integral part of former Yugoslav federation. 92% of
              the 2 million population in Kosovo are Albanians. They felt
              politically discriminated in the Yugoslav system. In 1989,
              Slobodan Milosevic comes to power as the leader of Serbia and
              ordered constitutional changes at the level of the Yugoslav
              federation, which were rejected by almost all Yugoslav republics
              and provinces.

              In response to the emerging dissatisfaction, Serbia initially
              attacks Slovenia and later manipulates and mobilizes local Serbs
              in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, who began fighting from
              1991 to 1995, with an estimated 200,000 civilians killed. In
              Kosovo, on the other hand, Serbia abolishes the autonomy that
              Kosovo had gained in 1974.
            </p>
            <p>
              In early 1998, police forces and units engaged by Serbia began
              mass killings in the Drenica region, killing 24 Albanian civilians
              in the villages of Qirez and Likoshan on 27 February (1998),
              including a child and a pregnant woman.
            </p>
            <p>
              From February 1998 to June 1999, an estimated 402 massacres were
              committed by Serbia against the Albanian civilian population in
              Kosovo, with over 13,000 people killed.

              It takes courage to talk about horrible war experiences. We are

              The reported cases have been taken from various sources and the
              main data have been verified by the Humanitarian Law Center.
