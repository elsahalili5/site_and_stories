        <p>
          On March 26, 1999, combined Serbian police and military forces
          surrounded the village of Celinë/Celina in the Municipality of
          Rahovec/Orahovac and began to enter Albanian houses, kicking out
          dozens of residents of this settlement, executing 76 of them,
          mutilating several persons while alive, among them 10 children, one
          barely 18 months old. The terror on the civilian population lasted for
          two whole days and the victims remained unburied for several days in
          their courtyards, basements, houses, and other spaces. One of the
          members of the Serbian Police has appeared before the International
          Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague, as a protected
          witness (K-41) providing testimony, inter alia, that they had a firm
          order to carry out a massacre of the Albanian civilian population in
          retaliation for the NATO bombing of the former Yugoslavia.
