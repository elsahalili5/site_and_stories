          On the night of May 2, 1999, over 180 people were killed by Serbia in
          the village of Studime/Sudimlja in Vushtrri/Vucitrn. Most of the
          victims were killed on a tractor on their way to Albania, while others
          were killed in their homes. All the victims were first robbed of up to
          1,000 Deutsche Marks per person, then they were subjected to having
          Serbian state insignia carved on their bodies by knife, and in the end
          they were all executed at close range.
