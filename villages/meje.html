          The village of Mejë/Meja in Gjakovë/Djakovica is duly considered and
          referred to as Kosovo’s Srebrenica. There, Serbian police, military,
          and units engaged by Serbia, within a few hours, killed all the boys
          and men captured alive in the 15 villages around Mejë/Meja. In the
          morning of April 27, 1999, units engaged by Serbia surrounded from all
          sides the area known as “Reka e Keqe” (Bad River) and entered every
          Albanian house, forcibly removing all boys and men over the age of 15
          years old from their homes and sending them away to the village of
          Mejë/Meja. Within a few hours, 284 people were killed and mutilated by
          axes by the Serbian Police. A few weeks later, Serbian forces returned
          to the site; in an attempt to cover up the crime, some bodies were
          exhumed, and they have been missing ever since. Some bodies have been
          found in mass graves in Serbia.
