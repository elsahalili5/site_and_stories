            <p><span>DATE:</span>1-2 APRIL 1999</p>
            <p>The horrific massacre that took place in Gjakovë/Djakovica, in the premises of Mehdi Vejsa’s house (accommodating members of four families), in the night between 1 and 2 April 1999, is the most authentic and terrifying evidence of Serbia’s crimes against the Albanian civilian population. On the tragic night, there were a total of 21 people in the basement, who were taken prisoner by the Serbian state police and special units. There was an elderly person with mental disabilities, 7 women aged 30-73 years old, and 13 children aged 2 to 15 years old. Members of Serbian Police and Special Units opened a barrage of fire from automatic weapons against this mass of women and children and, after executing them from close range, set the house on fire. Through smoke and flames, Dren Ali Caka (9 years old, wounded with two bullets to the chest) managed to get out of the window and escape, while his sister Diona (2 years old) was burned alive.</p>
