          On March 26, 1999, Serbian Police forces attacked the Berisha family
          in Suharekë/Suva Reka without any pretext. Upon approaching the house,
          they opened fire with automatic weapons and several members of the
          Berisha family were wounded. Serbian Police entered the house and
          dragged the injured, while other members of the Berisha family were
          ordered to enter a nearby facility (pizzeria). Once the Police made
          sure that all members of the Berisha family had entered the facility
          as ordered, they started throwing grenades inside the facility. 49
          members of the Berisha family were killed, including 23 children and a
          pregnant woman. After this act, Serbian Police load the victims onto a
          truck, several people who showed signs of life were shot in the head
          with an automatic weapon. The truck leaves in the direction of
          Prizren. Gramos Berisha, only 8 years old at the time, and his mother
          Vjollca and sister-in-law Shyhrete, pretended to be dead and while the
          victims were transported from Suharekë/Suva Reka to Prizren, they
          managed to jump from the truck and thus escaped. 23 members of the
          Berisha family have been found in a truck on Lake Batajnica in
          Belgrade, while several members of the Berisha family are still
          missing. An excerpt from Gramoz’s account of events: “There were some
          very young children, nine months old, who screamed the whole time,
          they cried, asked for water, but the Serbian Police did not stop
          shooting, until all the voices stopped and there were no more screams,
          in the that facility”, recounted Gramoz. Surrounded by dead bodies,
          Gramoz saw that his mother, Vjollca, and the wife of a family member,
          Shyhrete, were still alive. “On the way I heard a conversation, Mom
          with Shyhrete talking, communicating with each other, but I still did
          not dare raise my head thinking that we have someone in the truck, and
          we would be found out. I stood still like that, without moving at all.
          Along the way, my Mom recognized the jacket I was wearing, and she was
          saying I want to at least look at my son’s face one last time. When
          she turned me towards herself, I opened my eyes. She said: “Mozi, are
          you alive?” I said yes. She said, “Come with Mom, we are going to jump
          off the truck because these people will throw us a pit and we won’t be
          able to get out then”, recounts Gramoz. “Near me, there was this boy
          same age as me, Mirat, he was also alive in the truck. Mom and I tried
          to take him with us, we told him: “Come with us, let’s jump.” He
          started to scream and said: “No, I do not want to, just get this body
          away from me.” They had put a body on top of him, he could not
          breathe. “Just get it away, I don’t want to come. “I want to go with
          my Mom”, recounts Gramoz.
