            <p>The forces engaged by Serbia date back to April 21, 1999, surround the village of Nakarade in Fushë Kosovë / Kosovo Polje and storm the Mirena family homes. They first enter Hakif’s house and take him out of the house and his son, now a survivor, Safet. He instructs Hakif to go to the house of his brothers and relatives and place all the boys and men to come near his house. After a few moments in the place where the Serbian unit was looking for, there were 17 boys and men of the Mirena family leaning against the wall. Furthermore, the Serbian police opened fire and wounded Nazif Mirena in his post, and no one from his family was allowed to go near him to ask for help.

                After that, the combined police and military units of Serbia ordered all the boys and men of the Mirena family to make two trucks. Tire bodies were found seven years later buried in a mass grave near Belgrade.</p>
