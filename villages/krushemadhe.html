            <p>Serbia’s gruesome crimes against the Albanian civilian population in Kosovo have spared no location, village, or town in Kosovo. Serbia had engaged its entire police and military machinery against the Albanian civilian population and, as if that were not enough, Serbia had also engaged local Serbs in Kosovo in separate units to assist police and military formations. One such action undertaken by the police, the military and additional units engaged by Serbia was implemented in the village of Krushë e Madhe/Velika Krusa in Rahovec/Orahovac, where during three consecutive days, from 25 to 27 March 1999, these forces executed or mutilated more than 240 Albanian and Ashkali civilians from this village, while over 1 thousand houses were burned or completely destroyed by the Serbian machinery.

                A few weeks after the fact, aiming to cover up the crime, Serbia exhumed a large number of the victims, leading to their quiet disappearance, and even now (as of March 2021) over 60 people from this village are still missing.</p>
