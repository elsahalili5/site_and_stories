            <p>From May 1 to 15, 1999, numerous Serbian police and military forces laid siege to the village of Nabërgjan/Nabrdje in Pejë/Pec. During these days, the whole village was subjected to constant physical and psychological torture that Serbian forces exerted on the civilian population. As if that were not enough, these forces started removing boys and men from their homes and sending them to the vicinity of their camp where they were executed; some of the bodies were found after the war, completely burned.</p>
