          On January 15, 1999, three months after Serbia had pledged to the
          international community (Holbrooke-Milosevic Agreement of October
          1998) that it would not take any action against the Albanian
          population in Kosovo, Serbia killed and maimed while alive 38 Albanian
          civilians in Reçak/Recak, Municipality of Shtime/Stimlje. This action
          by Serbia was qualified as such by both the EU and the US in a joint
          statement. Serbian Police, assisted by a motorized military unit,
          surround the village at night, and on the morning of January 15,
          shelling begins from four different positions (from sites known as
          “Pishat”, “Gështenjat”, “Rrasa e Çallakut” and from the position known
          as “Çesta”). Around noon, Serbian Police forces advance into the
          village on foot, entering each house. Overwhelmed by fear, some
          villagers take refuge in the basement and farm of one of the villagers
          named Sadik Osman. About 40 Serbian Police manage to enter Osman’s
          farm and force out about 30 men and boys from the village, first they
          ask for and confiscate all documents, then proceed to brutally beat
          them with wooden sticks and metal batons, ordering them to walk in the
          direction of hill (site known as “Gropa e Bebushit”), where they start
          firing automatic weapons in their direction, 24 out of 30 men are
          killed in this place, while Ramë Shabani, Bilall Bilalli, Nesret
          Shabani, Ali Qazimi, and Imer Imeri, residents of Reçak/Recak village,
          covered by the killed bodies manage to make it out alive. On that same
          day, in other parts of the village of Reçak/Recak, Serbian forces
          killed 14 other people, some had been struck on the head with axes,
          three of them minors. The representative of the international civilian
          mission to Kosovo at that time, William Walker, upon visiting the
          scene after the withdrawal of Serbian forces, declared and qualified
          this act as a crime against humanity.
