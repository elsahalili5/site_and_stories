        <p class="story-description">
          On March 28, 1999, Serbian Special Forces known as “Scorpions”
          surrounded one of the neighborhoods in the center of Podujevë/Podujevo
          town, and positioned near the Bogujevci family house and began
          demolishing their doors and windows. In this situation, members of the
          Bogujevci, Duriqi and Llugaliu families leave the house in fear. At
          first, the Serbian forces instructed them to move through the
          neighbors’ yards and come out to the streets. After having approached
          the street close to the police station, an elderly man, Hamdi Duriqi,
          was shot. After a few minutes, members of Bogujevci, Duriqi and
          Llugaliu families are ordered to return back through the same road.
          Upon entering their neighbor’s yard, in the presence of the children,
          mother Shefkate Bogujevci is shot dead. After a few minutes, Serbian
          forces opened fire from many directions, leaving 13 women and children
          dead on the spot. 5 children of the Bogujevci family escape from the
          execution, although seriously injured; Fatos, Jehona, Saranda, Lirie
          and Genc.
